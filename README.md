# simplelog
simplelog is a logging package with the focus on simplicity and ease of use. It utilizes the log package from the standard library with some advanced features.
Once started, the simple logger runs as a service and listens for logging requests through the functions WriteTo[Stdout|File|Multiple].
As the name of the WriteTo functions suggests, the simple logger writes to either standard out, a log file, or multiple targets.
